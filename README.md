# incognito-node
Incognito Node is a plug and play mining device that slots into any room. Designed to power the Incognito network in a truly decentralized fashion, it validates confidential transactions and proposes new blocks. In return, it earns cryptocurrencies such as BTC and ETH. Node also earns Privacy, the native coin of Incognito, by mining block rewards.
